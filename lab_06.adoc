= Lab 6 - Monitoring Applications

Cloud Foundry provides several built-in mechanisms that allow us to monitor our applications' state changes and behavior.
Additionally, Cloud Foundry actively monitors the health of our application processes and will restart them should they crash.
In this lab, we'll explore a few of these mechanisms.

== Events

Cloud Foundry only allows application configuration to be modified via its API.
This gives application operators confidence that all changes to application configuration are known and auditable.
It also reduces the number of causes that must be considered when problems arise.

All application configuration changes are recorded as _events_.
These events can be viewed via the Cloud Foundry API, and viewing is facilitated via the CLI.

Take a look at the events that have transpired so far for our deployment of `guestbook`:

<1> Events are sorted newest to oldest, so we'll start from the bottom.
Here we see the `app.create` event, which created our application's record and stored all of its metadata (e.g. `memory: 512`).
<2> The `app.map-route` event records the incoming request to assign a route to our application.
<3> This `app.update` event records the resulting change to our applications metadata.
<4> This `app.update` event records the change of our application's state to `STARTED`.
<5> Remember scaling the application up? This `app.update` event records the metadata change `instances: 5`.
<6> And here's the `app.update` event recording our scaling of the application back down with `instances: 1`.

== Logs

One of the most important enablers of visibility into application behavior is logging.
Effective management of logs has historically been very difficult.
Cloud Foundry's https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator[log aggregation] components simplify log management by assuming responsibility for it.
Application developers need only log all messages to either `STDOUT` or `STDERR`, and the platform will capture these messages.

=== For Developers

Application developers can view application logs using the CF CLI.

. Let's view recent log messages for `cf-scale-boot`:
+
----
$ cf logs guestbook --recent
----
+
Here are two interesting subsets of one output from that command:

As you can see, Cloud Foundry's log aggregation components capture both application logs and CF component logs relevant to your application.
These events are properly interleaved based on time, giving you an accurate picture of events as they transpired across the system.

. To get a running ``tail'' of the application logs rather than a dump, simply type:
+
----
$ cf logs guestbook
----
+
You can try various things like refreshing the browser and triggering stop/start events to see logs being generated.

=== For Operators (OPTIONAL)

Application operators will also enjoy commands like `cf logs`, but are often interested in long-term retention, indexing, and analysis of logs as well.
Cloud Foundry currently only provides short-term retention of logs.
To meet these needs, Cloud Foundry provides the ability to http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/log-management.html[drain logs to third-party providers.]

In this section, we'll drain logs to a very simple provider called https://papertrailapp.com[Papertrail].

. Visit https://papertrailapp.com and create a free account.

. Login to your account and add your first system:
+
image::Common/images/papertrail_1.png[]

. Click on ``Heroku’’:
+
image::Common/images/papertrail_2.png[]

. Choose ``I use Heroku'' and provide a name:
+
image::Common/images/papertrail_3.png[]

. Note the URL + Port assigned to your application:
+
image::Common/images/papertrail_4.png[]

. We'll use a Cloud Foundry http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html[user-provided service instance] to create the log drain for our application using the URL + Port provided by Papertrail:
+
----
$ cf cups guestbook-logs -l syslog://logs3.papertrailapp.com:36251
Creating user provided service guestbook-logs in org Northeast / Canada / space cjd as cdecelles@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. We bind that service instance:
+
----
$ cf bs guestbook guestbook-logs
Binding service guestbook-logs to app guestbook in org Northeast / Canada / space cjd as cdecelles@pivotal.io...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage guestbook' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. We'll use a `cf restart` rather than `cf restage` to make the binding take effect:
+
----
$ cf restart guestbook
----

. Refresh the Papertrail browser tab to see log events immediately flowing to the log viewing page:
+
image::Common/images/papertrail_5.png[]

You can see how to connect to other third-party log management systems in the http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/log-management-thirdparty-svc.html[Cloud Foundry documentation].

== Health

Cloud Foundry's http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/#hm9k[Heatlh Manager] actively monitors the health of our application processes and will restart them should they crash.

. If you don't have one already running, start a log tail for `guestbook`:
+
----
$ cf logs guestbook
----

. Visit the application in the browser, and click on the ``Kill App’’ button. This button will trigger a JVM exit with an error code (`System.exit(1)`), causing the Health Manager to observe an application instance crash:
+
image::Common/images/Guestbook_scale_kill.png[]

. After clicking the kill app a couple of interesting things should happen.
First, you'll see an error code returned in the browser, as the request you submitted never returns a response:
+
image::Common/images/bad_gateway.png[]
+
Also, if you're paying attention to the log tail, you'll see some interesting log messages fly by:

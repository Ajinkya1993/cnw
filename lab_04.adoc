= Lab 4 - Binding to Cloud Foundry Services

[abstract]
--
The _Guestbook_ application was designed to illustrate the ease with which various types of data services can be bound to and utilized by Spring applications running on Cloud Foundry.
In this lab, we'll be binding the application to a PostgreSQL database.

Cloud Foundry services are managed through two primary types of operations:

Create/Delete:: These operations create or delete instances of a service.
For a database this could mean creating/deleting a schema in an existing multitenant cluster or creating/deleting a dedicated database cluster.
Bind/Unbind:: These operations create or delete unique credential sets for an existing service instance that can then be injected into the environment of an application instance.

== A Bit of Review

Your instance of _Guestbook_ should still be running from the end of link:lab_03.html[Lab 3].
Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI:

The _Guestbook_ application is currently running with an in-memory database, and isn’t bound to any services.
Let's change that.

== The Services Marketplace

There are two ways to discover what services are available on Pivotal Web Services.
The first is available on any instance of Cloud Foundry: the CLI. Just type:

----
$ cf marketplace
----

and you'll get a list of services, their available plans, and descriptions. On Pivotal Web Services, the ``free'' tier of plans is normally the first one listed (e.g. `turtle` for `elephansql`).

The second way is specific to PWS's Application Manager UI.
If you haven't already, login to it by visiting http://console.run.pivotal.io.

Click on the ``Marketplace'' link:

and you'll see the same service/plan/description listing in the browser:

== Creating and Binding to a Service Instance

. Let's begin by creating a PostgreSQL instance provided by http://www.elephantsql.com/[ElephantSQL].
From the CLI, let's _create_ a free ElephantSQL service instance:
+
----
$ cf create-service elephantsql turtle guestbook-db
Creating service instance guestbook-db in org Northeast / Canada / space cjd as cdecelles@pivotal.io...
OK

----

. Next we'll _bind_ the newly created instance to our `guestbook` application:
+
----
$ cf bs guestbook guestbook-db
Binding service guestbook-db to app guestbook in org Northeast / Canada / space cjd as cdecelles@pivotal.io...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage guestbook' to ensure your env variable changes take effect

----

. Notice the admonition to `Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect`.
Let's take a look at the environment variables for our application to see what's been done. We can do this by typing:
+
----
$ cf env guestbook
----
+
The subset of the output we're interested in is located near the very top, titled `System-Provided`:
+

----
<1> `VCAP_SERVICES` is a special Cloud Foundry environment variable that contains a JSON document containing all of the information for any services bound to an application.
<2> Notice here the unique URI for this instance of PostgreSQL that `guestbook` has been bound to.
====

. Now let's _restage_ the application, which cycles our application back through the staging/buildpack process before redeploying the application.footnote:[In this case, we could accomplish the same goal by only _restarting_ the application via `cf restart guestbook`.
A _restage_ is generally recommended because Cloud Foundry buildpacks also have access to injected environment variables and can install or configure things differently based on their values.]
+
----
$ cf restage guestbook
----
+
Once the application is running again, revisit or refresh the browser tab where you have the _Guestbook_ application loaded. Add a few guestbook messages.  The application is now utilizing a PostgreSQL database via the `guestbook-db` service and the data is now persisted in a service bound database instead of in-memory database:

. *(OPTIONAL STEPS)* If you have a PostgreSQL GUI tool handy (you can download a free one at http://www.pgadmin.org/download), you can also take a look at the _Guestbook_ data directly in the database.

. In pgAdmin, create a new server connection and populate the properties with values from the URI in your `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable (remember `cf env guestbook`!):
+

. Connect to the server and scroll (if necessary) until you find your specific database instance:
+
image::Common/images/pgadmin_db_instance.png[]

. Right-click on the `message` table and choose ``View Data > View All Rows'' to see the data inserted as part of _Guestbook_’s startup process:
